I'm Chris Keene. I'm based in Brighton, UK. nostuff.org has been my home on the web since around 2002.

My work is focused on digital libraries and scholarly communications, and innovative technology to support them.

I currently work at Jisc in London, overseeing projects and initatives to support and transform libraries and scholarly comms. I previously worked at the University of Sussex Library, overseeing technology related development, including discovery, online content, and open access.

You will find a collection of articles, ramblings and unchecked grammar in something that looks suspiciously like a blog.

You can also find me at:

140280 characters or less
read an exaggerated, yet dull, version of me on Linkedin
photos on Flickr, and also, more selectively, on instagram.
a collection of very random notes I kept on technical things while working at the Sussex University Library.
You can contact me by email, chriskeene gmailcom (you can work it out).

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
