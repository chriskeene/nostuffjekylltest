I'm Chris Keene.1 I'm based in Brighton, UK. nostuff.org has been my home on the web since around 2002.

My work is focused on digital libraries and scholarly communications, and innovative technology to support them.

I currently  [work at Jisc](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/)  in London, overseeing projects and initatives to support and transform libraries and scholarly comms. I previously worked at the University of Sussex Library, overseeing technology related development, including discovery, online content, and open access.

You will find a collection of  [articles, ramblings and unchecked grammar in something that looks suspiciously like a blog](https://www.nostuff.org/words/).

You can also find me at:

- [the hell site](http://www.twitter.com/chriskeene/)
- [read an exaggerated, yet dull, version of me on Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/chriskeene)
- [some random photos on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/chriskeene), and also, more selectively, on  [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chriskeene1/).
- [a collection of very random notes I kept on technical things while working at the Sussex University Library](http://work.nostuff.org/).
- You can contact me by email, chriskeene gmailcom (you can work it out).
