I'm Chris Keene. I'm based in Brighton, UK. nostuff.org has been my home on the web since around 2002.


My work so far has been around technology and digital environments in academic libraries and research. I currently  [work at Jisc](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/)  managing the technology and data that underpinds their library and research services. I previously worked at the University of Sussex Library, overseeing technology related development.

You will find a collection of  [articles, ramblings and unchecked grammar in something that looks suspiciously like a blog](https://www.nostuff.org/words/).

You can also find me at:

- [the hell site](http://www.twitter.com/chriskeene/)
- [read an exaggerated, yet dull, version of me on Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/chriskeene)
- [some random photos on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/chriskeene), and also, more selectively, on  [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chriskeene1/).
- [a collection of very random notes I kept on technical things while working at the Sussex University Library](http://work.nostuff.org/).
- You can contact me by email, chriskeene gmailcom (you can work it out).
